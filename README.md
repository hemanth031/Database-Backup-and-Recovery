##Database backup and recovery is a critical process that ensures data security, integrity, and availability in case of unexpected failures, system crashes, or accidental data loss. It involves creating a copy of the database at a specific point in time and storing it securely so that it can be restored if needed. Backups can be performed manually or automated using scripts and scheduling tools.
There are different types of database backups, including full backups (which store the entire database), incremental backups (which save only the changes made since the last backup), and differential backups (which include changes made since the last full backup). Backup strategies depend on business needs, data size, and recovery time objectives.
Recovery is the process of restoring the database from a backup, ensuring that all data remains intact and functional. The recovery process may include restoring data to a previous state, applying transaction logs, or even using replication and failover mechanisms for high availability.
Common tools for database backup and recovery include mysqldump for MySQL and pg_dump for PostgreSQL. These tools allow administrators to export database content and later restore it when needed. Automating database backups using cron jobs in Linux or task schedulers in Windows ensures that backups occur regularly, reducing the risk of data loss.
To maintain data integrity, verification methods such as checksum validation and test restorations should be implemented. A well-planned database backup and recovery strategy is essential for businesses to prevent downtime, data corruption, and financial losses due to unexpected failures.
